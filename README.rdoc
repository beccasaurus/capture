= capture

A simple gem for easily capturing writes to STDOUT, files, or any IO object.

I needed to write this for testing calls to #puts in an app and it took me 
awhile to get the code working properly (especially without having to 
write to the filesystem to get the output properly).

I figured that I might need this again or someone else might find this 
handy so ... here it is!
